# How to use code to meet girls:
## My Tinder bot ðŸ”¥

During 2 months I used this Tinder bot that provided me **63 Whatsapp contacts** of random girls. 
Basically, the bot is a **gamechat** where the girls have to answer 9 questions correctly in order to get my phone number ðŸ˜Ž

My system perform two operations:
* Hit random likes (200 per day)
* Answer questions to my matchs

### Integration with Telegram

I used Telegram bot that inform me of the new girls that complete the quiz:



### Infrastructure
* In order to comunicate with the Tinder API I used [this](https://github.com/charliewolf/pynder) Python wrapper.
* The full system was deployed at AWS (Amazon Web Services) under a free tier machine.

## Example

Here's my profile photo (I focused on catalan girls, so all the texts are in Catalan):

</p>

Basically, I present myself and explain the challenge.

Then, when the bot match with a girl, it send the first answer: **Wich is the capital of Sweden?**
2
And when the bot detects the correct answer it sends the next:
3
And so on...
4
5
6

Wow! Finally the target complete all the questions! Now he is awarded wit my phone number:
